## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Setup Project Directories**

   ```bash
   make setup-directories
   ```

3. **Setup the Virtual Environment**

   Before setting up the virtual environment, ensure you have `python3` installed on your machine.

   ```bash
   make setup_venv
   ```

   This will create a new virtual environment and install all necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

4. **Docker (Optional)**

   If you intend to run the application inside a Docker container, ensure you have Docker installed and running.

## Usage

- **Running the Dash App Locally**

   ```bash
   make run_dash_app
   ```

- **Working with Docker**

  - Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    make docker_build
    ```

  - Deploy the Docker container:

    ```bash
    make docker_deploy
    ```

  - To stop and remove the Docker container:

    ```bash
    make docker_stop
    ```

## Development Commands

Here are some of the main `Makefile` commands you might use during development:

- `make help`: Display a list of available commands.
