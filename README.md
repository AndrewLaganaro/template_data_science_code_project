## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Setup Project Directories**

   ```bash
   make setup-directories
   ```

3. **Setup the Virtual Environment**

   Before setting up the virtual environment, ensure you have `python3` installed on your machine.

   ```bash
   make setup_venv
   ```

   This will create a new virtual environment and install all necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

4. **Docker (Optional)**

   If you intend to run the application inside a Docker container, ensure you have Docker installed and running.

## Usage

- **Running the Dash App Locally**

   ```bash
   make run_dash_app
   ```

- **Working with Docker**

  - Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    make docker_build
    ```

  - Deploy the Docker container:

    ```bash
    make docker_deploy
    ```

  - To stop and remove the Docker container:

    ```bash
    make docker_stop
    ```

## Running in Codespaces

If you are using GitHub Codespaces, you launch Jupyter or run the dash application from Codespaces. 
Just run the make commands from the terminal in Codespaces.



## Development Commands

Here are some of the main `Makefile` commands you might use during development:

- `make help`: Display a list of available commands.
- `make setup-directories`: Set up the directory structure for the project.
- `make setup_venv`: Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
- `make test`: Run tests using pytest.
- `make docker_build`: Build a Docker image for the project.
- `make docker_deploy`: Deploy the application using Docker.
- `make ci`: Run a full CI/CD sequence, which includes tests, Docker image building, and Docker deployment.
- `make docker_stop`: Stop and remove the Docker container.
- `make clean`: Clean up the development environment (remove virtual environment and Docker image).

 Directory Descriptions:

- **data/**: This is the primary directory where all the data related to the project resides. Data is further categorized into raw, processed, and external to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used throughout the project. `exploratory/` contains initial data exploration and experimentation notebooks, while `report/` has the finalized notebooks for presentation and reporting purposes.
  
- **src/**: The source code of the project resides here. This might include modules, scripts, and other necessary code files.

- **tests/**: This directory is dedicated to testing. It contains test scripts, fixtures, and other testing-related files to ensure the codebase's functionality and robustness.

- **Makefile**: This is a simple way to manage project tasks. It provides a set of commands for setting up the environment, running tests, building Docker images, and more. It also serves as a form of documentation for the project. If you are running on Windows, you can refer to the `Makefile` commands and run the equivalent commands in the command prompt.
